# Object-Oriented Programming

## SOLID

* The [**single-responsibility principle**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle):
    "There should never be more than one reason for a class to change." In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.
* The [**open–closed principle**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open–closed_principle):
    "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
* The [**Liskov substitution principle**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle):
    "Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it."
* The [**interface segregation principle**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle):
    "Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."
* The [**dependency inversion principle**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle):
    "Depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."
